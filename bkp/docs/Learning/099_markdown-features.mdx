# Markdown Features

```text title="Features.md"
Markdown is a simple markup language that allows you to write documents in a readable and easy-to-read way. It is designed to be easily converted into HTML and other markup languages, but can also be used as a stand-alone way to write documents.

Basic Markdown commands include:

Titles: To create titles, use one or more # before the text. For example, ## Title 1 is the level 1 title, ## Title 2 is the level 2 title and so on. Bold and italics: To make text bold, use * or __ before and after the text. To italicize text, use or _ before and after the text.

Lists: To create lists, use or - before the text. For example, Item 1, * Item 2 creates an unordered list.

Links: To create a link, use text

Images: To add an image, use text

Code: To add a block of code, use ``` before and after the code.

```text title="my-doc.md"
// highlight-start
---
id: my-doc-id
title: My document title
description: My document description
slug: /my-custom-url
---
// highlight-end
```

These are just some of the basic Markdown commands. There are a variety of other commands available to help you format your documents clearly and legibly.

Tip: To make your markdown formatting look good it is also important to use tabs correctly.

## Images

Regular Markdown images are supported.

You can use absolute paths to reference images in the static directory (`static/img/docusaurus.png`):

```md
![Docusaurus logo](/img/docusaurus.png)
```
