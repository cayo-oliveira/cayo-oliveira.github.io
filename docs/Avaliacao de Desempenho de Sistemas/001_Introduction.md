## System Performance Evaluation

## Purpose of the Course

The purpose of this course is to study, fix and apply methods and models for System Performance Evaluation.

## Program

### Measurement

This topic will cover basic concepts, operational laws, measurement techniques and tools, exploratory data analysis, and statistical inference. The techniques will be evaluated for system performance evaluation and not in a generic way. The examples used will be from the world of system performance, especially computer systems.

### Models

This topic covers Markov chains, Markovian queues, stochastic Petri nets, and stochastic simulation.

## For the Next Class

For the next class, students should watch class0_ADS for discussion and go to the basic concepts part, which involves: measurement, models, analytical solutions, numerical solutions, and simulation.

## Methodology 

Usually the classes are held in the laboratory, where the concepts are exposed and practiced. It is important to practice and deepen the tools to work. Students use tools and apply concepts in a given environment, doing small exercises.

## Tooling

There is use of many tools, so it is necessary to practice and deepen the knowledge to work with them.

## Final Objective

The final objective of this course is to form an orchestrator who can use a series of tools to try to use the methods and generate harmony between them. It is important to have the ability to integrate these tools.

### Strategies

The strategies used will be Markov chains, Markovian queues, stochastic Petri nets, and stochastic simulation. Each of these strategies has advantages and disadvantages, so it is important to know when and how to apply them. There are diagrams that guide the use of each tool.

## Exercise List

The exercise list does not allow for delays. Those who attend the classes and do the exercises receive the lists. Students can consult all the tools and books needed to do the exercises. It is important to explain the reason for each decision made.
